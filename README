MY ALLOCATORS

=================================================

This repository contains a list of memory allocators that I've made in various languages, including C, C++, etc.

You can build the example with cmake.

The `alloc-workspace.vim` file contains: CMakeLists.txt, heap.c, heap.h, and main.c. To view, run `vim -S alloc-workspace.vim -u .vimrc`.
